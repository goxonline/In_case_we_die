# In_case_we_die

This repository was created to be saved in the Arctic Code Vault. The only purpose, is to inform anyone who finds it and if for some reason our great race (I'm just kidding, we're simple mammals) disappears because of some disaster caused by ourselves (Note that we have already broken our climate and just so you're aware, right now, there's an outbreak of a deadly new virus, yes, we're well on our way to disappearing).

I wouldn't know the exact date when I wrote this, because our calendar is created by a religious leader, who in turn bases it on the birth of another religious... yes... bullshit.

I've had a good life, well I have a lot of life left to live (that is if the third world war doesn't happen first, yes, we've already had two!).

In the last 100 years (one year is equivalent to one lap of our planet around the sun), we have evolved a lot, except for that part of our race that believes that accumulating money is a sign of power... (only 1%). The rest of us are surviving in the hope that everything will change.

We create electronics, computers and entertainment... Of course, we could be curing diseases and solving social problems... But it's more profitable to create meaningless entertainment elements... and porn, there's so much porn. Quantifying the amount of porn there is scientifically impossible!

Many of us believe that a good apocalypse could put us in our place and change the order of our properties... Maybe an alien attack... Who knows? Well, you will know...
